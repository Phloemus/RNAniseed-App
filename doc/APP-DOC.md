# Application documentation (Frontend)

The **app** part of the Application is the frontend. It consumes data sent by the API.

## Launching the application

The application is created using the ReactJS framework. Thus, to launch the developpment version of 
the application simply execute this command in the **app** directory:

```bash
npm start
```

## Creating the production build

ReactJS needs to be built in order to be publised in a production environment. 
To build the application:

```bash
npm run build
```

A more performant version of the application is created and can be published directly on the server in 
the **/cellxgene/app** directory
