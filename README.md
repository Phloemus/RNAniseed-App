# RNAniseed Application : The single cell RNA seq visual tool

The RNAniseed Application is a tool allowing the ascidian community to explore large single cell 
RNA seq datasets visually. RNAniseed uses the Aniseed database making the exploration easier and 
more accurate.

The project is to ensure an easy way to explore single cell data as well as proposing a tool 
to centralize the datasets in order to improve the comparison potential of such data.

## How to use RNAniseed ?

RNAniseed is currently in developement. But the tool will be disponible on Aniseed *(https://aniseed.fr)*
when the project will be finised. Anyone should have access to the visual tool as well as the public 
datasets uploaded by the community.

Using RNAniseed is easy:

1. Go on RNAniseed *(https://aniseed.fr/rnaniseed)*
2. Select the mode you want to use (exploration for 1 dataset, comparison for multiple datasets)
3. Indicate the species, the datasets and the development cell stage you want
4. Launch the visualization
5. Explore the data as you want
