# RNAniseed Application : The single cell RNA seq visual tool

The RNAniseed Application is a tool allowing the ascidian community to explore large single cell 
RNA seq datasets visually. RNAniseed uses the Aniseed database making the exploration easier and 
more accurate.

The project is to ensure an easy way to explore single cell data as well as proposing a tool 
to centralize the datasets in order to improve the comparison potential of such data.

# How to use RNAniseed ?

RNAniseed is currently in developement. But the tool will soon be disponible on Aniseed website *(https://aniseed.fr)*
Anyone should have access to the visual tool as well as the public datasets uploaded by the community.

Using RNAniseed is easy:

1. Go on RNAniseed *(https://aniseed.fr/rnaniseed)*
2. Select the mode you want to use (**exploration** for 1 dataset, **comparison** for multiple datasets)
3. Indicate the **species**, the **datasets** and the **development cell stage** you want to investigate on
4. Hit the "Launch visualization" button
5. Explore the data as you want by using the **filters** disponible and the by looking for the expression of a **gene** or **geneset**

## Using the virtual tool 

The virtual tool of RNAniseed rely on cellxgene: an easy to use interface for single cell RNA seq exploration. This interface allow you to perform custom queries using the filters disponible on the 
left side bar.

Usually the main issue of single cell data is the lack of information needed to perform these kind of 
queries like the cell type, the development stage, metadata about genes etc...

To counter this problem, RNAniseed uses relevant data from Aniseed. This way, many more filters are disponible to perform a queries in the visual interface. 

## Possible queries using RNAniseed 

Earing about queries might scare you a bit as it often heavily related to informatics but performing a query doesn't need to be tedious. For instance, combining filters by clicking on the buttons of the left side bar of the visual interface is a way to query your data so easily, you might not even realized that you performed any kind of complicated query by doing so.

However,
