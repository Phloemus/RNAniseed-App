# RNAniseed Specification Book

The RNAniseed specification book (*"cahier des charge"* in french) is a document listing 
the goals of the project, the public for whom the tool is design for and the technical 
specifications that are involved in the conception of the project.

## The public

The public of the project is the ascidian community and the scientific community at large 
with none or little background in informatics but who still want to explore and visualize 
large single cell RNAseq datasets. 

First the project will focus on the ascidian community and will be tight to the Aniseed 
database as a data provider of single cell RNA seq data. The proximity with the Aniseed 
database will allow to deploy a visualization tool that can be used easily by the ascidian
community. 

Later when the project will be mature enough and the visualization tool will be reworked 
in order to be reused by the scientific community more broadly by providing a simple 
integration with external databases.

## The Goals 

Visualisation of single cell RNA seq data require using R or python, which many biologists
are not familiar with. This is a pain point that prevent the adoption of single cell data 
exploration despite all the potential of this method for ascidian development. 

The main goal of this project is to eliminate this pain point by providing an easy to use 
visualization tool for biologist having none or little background in informatics.

In general, statistics and clusterization are performed on such large datasets. This is 
also the case for this tool, which makes the biologist able to identify clusters in the 
single cell data and filter them using a rich variety of filters.

The clusterization and the filters gives the RNAniseed tool two purposes: 

1. **Exploration of a dataset:** The user should be able to find a dataset to explore using 
                                 the virtual tool and navigate in the data easily using the 
                                 filters disponible to guid the data exploration

2. **Comparison of datasets:** The biologist should be able to compare visually two datasets
                               using the clusterisation as a visual indicator as well as the 
                               the level of gene expression and laveraging the filtration of 
                               certain parameters for more accurate dataset comparisons  

The main focus of the tool is to be easy to use. Developping a well designed user interface
and a solid link with all the databases serving as data providers will be mendatory for the 
success of the project.
